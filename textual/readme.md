# Monokai Night theme for [Textual](https://www.codeux.com/textual/)

I love IRC and hanging out in various Freenode channels.

I wasn't happy with any of the default themes Textual comes with so I made this theme. Here is how it looks:

I am using `Lucida Sans Regular` font.

## Install

To install the theme, download the Monokai Night folder attached [here](Monokai%20Night).

Then go to Textual app. Go to preferences and in Styles click on `Browse Styles` here:
