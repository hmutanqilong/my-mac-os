# [BetterTouchTool](https://www.boastr.net)
I mainly use BTT to [customize different trackpad gestures](https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev/take-control-of-your-touchpad-on-macos-45c581f542e0#.7n1ye6vze) either globally or on per app basis. I also use BTT for all my window management needs.

You can find the [PDF file](./gestures.pdf) with all the custom gestures I have made together with a [downloadable Profile](https://cdn.rawgit.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os/master/btt/Main.bttpreset) that you can import to your BetterTouchTool to get all gestures I setup for myself.

I also use BTT to modify my TouchBar. Here is how it looks:

It includes, from left to right:
1. A coffee cup when I am on break. My breaks are scheduled throughout the day with [Focus](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/focusing/focusing).
2. My [current active TODO](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows/tree/master/todo-task#readme)
3. Battery percentage
4. Current time, day and month number

This is also included in the above preset.
